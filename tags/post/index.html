It was a fun reading, but I found the book unclear on a very specific point and I want to express my thoughts on it in this blog post. I may have misinterpreted the author&rsquo;s explanations but this doesn&rsquo;t invalidate the following reflection.
How to define an event stream? As the book is about Event Sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), events are naturally the central building block: they&rsquo;re used to store states and trigger effects in the system.</div><div class=read-more><a href=/posts/events-as-a-means-of-communication/>Read more ›</a></div></article><article class=post-list><div class=title-group><div class=title><h1><a href=/posts/reaching-a-limit-of-reactive-programming/>Reaching a limit of Reactive Programming</a></h1></div><div class=info-group><div class=date><h5>Nov 12, 2025</h5></div><div class=tags><span title=Tags>🏷</span><div class="horizontal-links links"><a href=/tags/post/>Post</a><a href=/tags/en/>En</a></div></div></div></div class="title-group"><div class=content>In my career, I had (and still have) many opportunities to develop UIs on desktop and web applications using various technologies.

Even if there are several ways to store and represent the same information, these ways are not all equivalent.

The solution wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but it was &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; and even more, respectful of people&rsquo;s time.

I think it was a good read and I achieved my goal, even though I didn&rsquo;t feel able to design a complete system using this pattern.
However, I realized I&rsquo;m using some actor model concepts for a few years now.</div><div class=read-more><a href=/posts/using-processes-for-better-resilience/>Read more ›</a></div></article><article class=post-list><div class=title-group><div class=title><h1><a href=/posts/cqrs-es-how-to-achieve-a-good-event-granularity/>CQRS/ES: How to achieve a good event granularity?</a></h1></div><div class=info-group><div class=date><h5>Dec 18, 2024</h5></div><div class=tags><span title=Tags>🏷</span><div class="horizontal-links links"><a href=/tags/post/>Post</a><a href=/tags/en/>En</a></div></div></div></div class="title-group"><div class=content>If you&rsquo;ve already developed a software using the event sourcing pattern, you&rsquo;ve probably faced difficulty: How-to design good events?

In this blog post, I will share with you these heuristics.
