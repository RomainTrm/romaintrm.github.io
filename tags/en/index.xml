      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently gave a talk with my friend Aur√©lien about the heuristics we&amp;rsquo;ve developed after using CQRS/ES for several years.&#xA;After our talk, we had a chat with some developers.

On the opposite side, choosing an event-based systems (event sourced or event driven) will very often be heavily challenged.</description>

      <description>I had the chance to work few months in Agicap, an enterprise producing a cashflow management SAAS for businesses.&#xA;It was a great mission, my team worked a way that I consider to be, so far, the most efficient and pleasant in my career. We managed to produce value at a constant speed while keeping a full control of our code, not allowing any kind of quality depreciation over time.</description>
