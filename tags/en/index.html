        If you&rsquo;ve already developed a software using the event sourcing pattern, you&rsquo;ve probably faced difficulty: How-to design good events? What is a good event granularity?
Indeed it&rsquo;s difficult to produce good events that will not harm our design. As a seasoned developer with event sourcing, I&rsquo;m still struggling with this, even if I&rsquo;ve developed several heuristics over time.
In this blog post, I will share with you these heuristics. But keep in mind this is not some kind of best practices.

        Nowadays, most of the services we&rsquo;re using are online and available 24/7. If, like me, you&rsquo;re working on a company that provide this kind of service, you&rsquo;re probably aiming for such availability. As I&rsquo;ve already highlighted it, it has a huge influence on how you should code and deploy your software. Indeed, to maximize availability, you&rsquo;re probably aiming for a zero downtime deployment.
Zero downtime deployment includes several topics. Today I want to focus on how to achieve a database migration without service interruption.

        I&rsquo;ve recently gave a talk with my friend Aurélien about the heuristics we&rsquo;ve developed after using CQRS/ES for several years.
After our talk, we had a chat with some developers. We concluded that choosing a state-based oriented approach (like CRUD) seems to be the default solution, such choice seems to remain unchallenged. On the opposite side, choosing an event-based systems (event sourced or event driven) will very often be heavily challenged.

        I had the chance to work few months in Agicap, an enterprise producing a cashflow management SAAS for businesses.
It was a great mission, my team worked a way that I consider to be, so far, the most efficient and pleasant in my career. We managed to produce value at a constant speed while keeping a full control of our code, not allowing any kind of quality depreciation over time.
