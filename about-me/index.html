<p>Hi! My name is Romain BERTHON. Welcome to my personal tech blog.</p>
<p><img src="1.jfif" alt="Portrait of me"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working as a professional software developer since I graduated in 2014. My main experience is on the <em>back end</em> side, but I also have some experience on the <em>UI</em> side, first with desktop clients (<em>Windows Form</em>, <em>WPF</em> then <em>UWP</em>) and now with web clients.</p>
<p>Early in my career, I&rsquo;ve been introduced to craft practices and techniques like <em>TDD</em>, <em>BDD</em>, <em>DDD</em> or <em>Extreme-Programming</em>. I&rsquo;m using them on a daily basis. I also share about them on this blog and at community events like conferences and local meetups.</p>
<h3 id="about-this-blog">ABOUT THIS BLOG</h3>
<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve accumulated a lot of experience on various topics. I try to write about topics where I think my experience is valuable enough to be shared (with you and the future self). I also regroup talks that I gave at conferences.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to write all my new posts in English. However, I had another blog where I was used to publishing in French. As I have retrieved my old articles here, you will find content in French and English in this blog.</p>
